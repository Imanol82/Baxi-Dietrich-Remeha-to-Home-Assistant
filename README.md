# Welcome to my first project!

Hi!
This is Imanol82.
Here you have my first project.
With this project we can connect any Baxi/Dietrich/Remeha Aerotermia with Home Assistant using Modbus. 
For this we will need the GTW-08 that converts the RBus into Modbus.

I have created two simple thermostats to control DHW and HVAC.

Over time we will complete it more.

Thanks!
